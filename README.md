# My USACO Contest Solutions
I'm a student seeking to gain experience in algorithms and data structures while improving my computational thinking skills through competing in USACO contests. Here are my solutions to problems from past contests. I hope that you'll find them useful. Feel free to share fresh insights and approaches to problems here that you've completed as well :)
